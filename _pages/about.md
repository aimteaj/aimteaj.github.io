I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton](https://www.fau.edu/). I also serve as a Faculty Fellow at the Institute for Sensing and Embedded Network Systems Engineering (I-SENSE) at FAU. Besides that, I am the Founding Director of the **Secure Prediction, Edge AI and Multimodal LLM Lab [[SPEED Lab]](https://www.speedlab.network)**.

My research focuses on building **robust, secure, efficient, and trustworthy AI systems**, with an emphasis on large vision-language models, agentic AI, federated learning, multimodal LLMs, and edge intelligence. I am particularly interested in control-theory of LLMs and distributed intelligence, and practical deployment in autonomous transportation, smart city, surveillance, operational intelligence for mission critical situations, underwater robot, agriculture and healthcare applications.
