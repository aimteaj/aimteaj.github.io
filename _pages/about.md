I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University. I also serve as a Faculty Fellow at the Institute for Sensing and Embedded Network Systems Engineering (I-SENSE) at FAU. Besides that, I am the Founding Director of the **Secure Prediction, Edge AI and Multimodal LLM Lab [[SPEED Lab]](https://www.speedlab.network)**.

My research focuses on building **robust, secure, efficient, and trustworthy AI systems**, with an emphasis on large vision-language models, agentic AI, federated learning, multimodal LLMs, and edge intelligence. I am particularly interested in control-theory of large language models and practical deployment of the frameworks in autonomous transportation, smart city, surveillance and operational intelligence for mission critical contexts, underwater and healthcare.

My work has been supported by the **National Science Foundation (NSF)**, **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**, **National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot** and **ORAU Research Innovation Partnership Grant**. Our research has been published in leading venues including CVPR, AAAI, ICCV, BigData, ICDCS, ICMLA, COMPSAC, and IEEE Transactions.

## Research Interests

- Large Vision-Language Models and Multimodal LLMs
- Federated Learning and Distributed Inference
- Agentic and Trustworthy AI
- Adversarial Robustness and AI Security  
- Distributed and Edge AI Systems
- Quantum AI

I am always interested in collaborating on research.
