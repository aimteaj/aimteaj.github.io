I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and the Director of the **Secure Prediction, Edge AI and Multimodal LLM (SPEED) Lab**.

My research focuses on building **robust, secure, and efficient AI systems**, with an emphasis on federated learning, vision language models, multimodal large language models, and edge intelligence. I am particularly interested in advancing adversarial robustness, distributed optimization, and trustworthy multimodal AI for real world deployment.

My work has been supported by the **National Science Foundation (NSF)** and the **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**. Our research has been published in leading venues including CVPR, ICDCS, and COMPSAC, with recent contributions on robust federated learning under data scarcity and adversarial meta-learning.

At SPEED Lab, we aim to design AI systems that are secure by design, adaptive under heterogeneity, and efficient for deployment across distributed and resource constrained environments.

## Research Interests

- Federated Learning and Federated Meta Learning  
- Vision Language Models and Multimodal LLMs  
- Adversarial Robustness and AI Security  
- Distributed and Edge AI Systems  
- Secure and Efficient Machine Learning  

I am always interested in collaborating on research that advances secure and scalable AI systems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
